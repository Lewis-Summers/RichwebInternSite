        </header>
        <h1>What I learned</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Gained experience with networking hardware like switches and routers</li>
            <li>Learned about VLANs and Firewalls</li>
            <li>Learned Linux commands like sudo, virsh, nano</li>
            <li>Learned about routing protocols like OSPF and BGP</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>What I liked most</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>I liked that we got to collaborate on labs instead of we all did them individually</li>
        </ul> 

        <h1>What I liked least</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>I think the internship could be cut short by one week, since we finished the labs early</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>What I think needs improvement</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>I belive that there should be more opportunities for interns to talk to employees and look at the work they do on a day to day basis.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Would I recommend the program?</h1>
            <p>I would recommend the program to anyone that is interested in networking, or in anything similar. Even if they aren't interested in networking, I think it would be a good experience to learn about Linux and explore other areas of CS.</p>
