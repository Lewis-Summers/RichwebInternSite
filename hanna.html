                <p> Hi, I'm Hanna Nash and I'm from Powhatan, Virginia.
                    I currently attend Randolph Macon College. I will be completing
                    a bachelor of science with a double major of Computer Science & Cybersecurity.
                    I created the RMC Robotics Club and compete in eSports! 
                    I will be graduating from Randolph Macon in May 2026.

                <h2> Summary of what was learned</h2>
                <p> Learning what each protocol looked like in the real world.
                </p>
                <p> Configuring different OS's. </p>
                <p> Learning how to work with a team with other like-minded 
                    individuals who were as confused in the beginning as me.

                <p> Being able to work with various equipment.</p>
                <p> Being able to experiment and problem solve within our own
                    created lab.
                </p>
                <p> Being able to see the physical outputs of what was taught
                    to me in college on a hypothetical sense. Like seeing how 
                    we could actually use tcpdump to diagonse what is wrong with
                    our network.

                <h1> What I liked the Least</h1>
                <p> Not interacting as often with other employees. I know there
                    wasn't as much down time to be able to do that however. 
                </p>
                <p> Working with an interesting individual</p>

            <div class="card">
            <h1> What would I improve?</h1>
            <p> More explanation on some of the trickier subjects that 
                weren't explicitly explained in the lab.
            </p>

            <div class="card">
            <h1> Would I recommend this to others or come back?</h1>
            <p> Yes! I would recommend this to other people because
                it was a very valuable experience being able to work within your
                own lab where you can experiment along with configuring your
                own equipment.

            <div class="card">
                <h1> Would I come back?</h1>
                <p>
                I would come back to teach others or explaining some of the more
                confusing portions.
