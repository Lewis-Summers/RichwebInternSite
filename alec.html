                <h4>What I Learned at Richweb:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>I gained hands-on experience with networking equipment and configurations.</li>
                    <li>I learned how to configure and use routing protocols like OSPF, BGP, and static routes.</li>
                    <li>I set up networking tools such as VLANs, VNETs, DHCP, DNS, and static IPs.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>What I Liked the Most and Least:</h4>
                <p>
                    I liked that we were free to experiment and troubleshoot configuration issues. It’s a unique experience to have your own sandbox network to break and learn from.
                    <br><br>
                    As for what I liked the least: I wish we had more interaction with Richweb employees, like observing real tickets. I understand it’s hard to coordinate, though.

                <h4>What I Think Could Be Improved:</h4>
                <p>
                    Introducing more types of labs—like the Splunk lab I created—would be interesting. More options would help expose us to various tools and applications.

                <h4>Would I Recommend the Program?</h4>
                <p>
                    I would definitely recommend the program to other students. It’s a unique opportunity to learn and implement networks in a sandbox environment. <br> <br> Dear Chloe, thank you for the opportunity to be a part of the NEATrack program. I really appreciate you being patient and helping us with our lab issues.
