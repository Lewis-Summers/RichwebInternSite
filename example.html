         <ul>
            <li> Working with the various equipment </li>
            <li> Being able to experiment and problem solve within the 
                lab
            </li>
            <li> Being able to understand what I learned in college
                on a hypothetical sense. Like seeing how different 
                protocols are used.

            <h1> What I liked the Least</h1>
            <ul>
                <li> Not interacting as often with other employees</li>
                <li> Working with an <i> interesting </i> individual</li>
            </ul>

         <section>
            <h1> What would I improve?</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    More explanation on some of the trickier subjects that
                    weren't explicitly explained in the lab
                </li>
            </ul>

         <section>
            <h1> Would I recommend this to others or come back?</h1>
            <p> Yes! I would recommend this to other people because
                it was a very valuable experience being able to work within your
                own lab where you can experiment along with configuring your
                own equipment.
            </p>
            <p>
                I would come back to teach others or explaining some of the more
                confusing portions.
