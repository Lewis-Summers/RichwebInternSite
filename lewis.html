                <h3>What I learned</h3>
                <p>I learned so much about all networking concepts. I now feel confident that almost regardless of what a customer or project needs I have the tools to problem solve my way through it.</p>

                <h3>Most and Least Favorite Part</h3>
                <p>
                    My favorite part was probably the hands on aspect of it. I love being able to break and fix the things. My least favorite part was probably getting stuck and not having access to help for several hours or a full day.

                <h3>What I would Improve</h3>
                <p>I would improve the hiring and vetting process of interns....(abhinav). I would have liked to have a activity where we have a list of customer needs but aren't told how to solve the probelm, we just pick what we think is the best thing for our usecase.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box box4">
                <h3>Would I recommond this to others?</h3>
                <p>I absolutely would recommend this to others intrested in working with computers, networking or otherwise. I feel like I have a signifigantly better understanding of how networks work and function that I believe will help me in the future.</p>
